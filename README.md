By 2025, approximately 27 billion devices will connect to the internet. These increasing IoT devices need new
connectivity requirements to have reliable and effective communication.

Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is a wireless data communication protocol that fulfills the requirements of
the Internet of Things by offering multiple features like Low latency, and long-range communication at low power and low cost. This paper based on the key technologies of LPWAN, their technical differences, some
IoT-based application scenarios in terms of IoT factors, and the challenges of these technologies.
